The automotive industry is competitive, and understanding what drives sales is critical for sustainable growth. This dashboard tells the story of how car sales evolved over time, how different brands performed, and what regions and time periods generated the most revenue.

The data begins with a clear view of overall performance — total revenue, units sold, and average selling price — giving stakeholders an instant snapshot of business health.

Drilling deeper, we discovered that a few top-performing brands consistently dominated sales, contributing significantly to revenue. These insights can influence marketing budgets and inventory planning.
